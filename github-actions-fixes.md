# GitHub Actions Fixes for centralcoastswim.com

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Missing File Endings
- **Problem**: The `.github/workflows/cleanup-preview.yml` and `.github/workflows/preview.yml` files were missing newlines at the end, which can cause parsing issues in some systems.
- **Fix**: Added proper newlines at the end of both workflow files.

### 2. GitHub Pages Branch Setup Issues
- **Problem**: The preview workflow assumed a `gh-pages` branch existed, which could cause failures if the branch wasn't set up.
- **Fix**: Added logic to create the `gh-pages` branch if it doesn't exist and added `continue-on-error: true` to the checkout step.

### 3. Image Optimization Script Robustness
- **Problem**: The `scripts/optimize-images.js` script could fail if expected directories or files don't exist, causing the entire workflow to fail.
- **Fix**: Added comprehensive error handling:
  - Check if input files exist before processing
  - Check if directories exist before trying to read them
  - Graceful error handling that logs errors but doesn't crash the build
  - Exit with status 0 even if optimization fails (since it's not critical)

### 4. Deploy Workflow Configuration
- **Problem**: Missing proper GitHub Pages setup configuration.
- **Fix**: Added `actions/configure-pages@v4` step to ensure proper Pages configuration.

### 5. Git Operations Error Handling
- **Problem**: Git operations in the preview workflow could fail if there were conflicts or if the remote branch didn't exist.
- **Fix**: Added `|| true` to git pull operations to prevent failures from stopping the workflow.

## Files Modified

1. `.github/workflows/cleanup-preview.yml` - Added newline and improved error handling
2. `.github/workflows/preview.yml` - Added gh-pages branch creation logic and error handling
3. `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` - Added proper Pages setup configuration
4. `scripts/optimize-images.js` - Added comprehensive error handling and file existence checks

## Expected Results

These fixes should resolve the GitHub Actions errors by:
- Ensuring workflows can handle missing branches or directories
- Providing graceful fallbacks when operations fail
- Preventing build failures from non-critical operations like image optimization
- Properly configuring GitHub Pages deployment

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test the main deploy workflow by pushing to the main branch
2. Test the PR preview workflow by creating a pull request
3. Verify that GitHub Pages is properly configured in the repository settings
4. Check that the repository has the necessary permissions for GitHub Actions to deploy to Pages

## Additional Notes

The workflows now include better error handling and should be more resilient to common deployment issues. If problems persist, check:
- Repository GitHub Pages settings
- Repository permissions for GitHub Actions
- Branch protection rules that might interfere with automated deployments
